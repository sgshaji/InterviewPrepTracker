Absolutely — here’s a polished and structured version of your feedback for both the **Application Page** and **Preparation Page**, rewritten with clarity, context, and implementation precision.

---

## ✅ Application Page Feedback

### 1. Remove “Follow-Up Date” Column

* **Action:** Eliminate the `Follow-Up Date` column from both the UI table and the data model if not used elsewhere.
* **Rationale:** It's currently unused or inconsistently populated. Follow-ups can be managed via reminders or tasks in the Interview Tracker instead.

### 2. Adjust Column Widths for Readability

* **Action:** Resize columns to ensure dropdown values (e.g., `Application Stage`, `Job Status`) are **fully visible** without truncation.
* **Suggested Fix:** Use content-aware sizing or set min-widths for dropdown columns. Allow horizontal scroll if necessary on smaller screens.

### 3. Auto-fill “Application Stage” for Applied Roles

* **Action:** For all entries where `Job Status = Applied` and `Application Stage` is empty, default the stage to `In Review`.
* **Rationale:** Prevents logic breaks later when determining interview readiness or status-based flows.

### 4. Auto-fill “Application Stage” for Rejected Entries

* **Action:** If `Job Status = Rejected` and `Application Stage` is blank, default `Application Stage = Rejected`.
* **Rationale:** Ensures consistency in downstream filtering, reporting, and rejection analysis.

## ✅ Preparation Page Feedback

### 1. Remove Future-Dated Rows

* **Action:** Do not display rows for future dates (e.g., if today is **May 26, 2025**, there should be no entries for **May 27 or later**).
* **Rationale:** Prevents confusion. Preparation logs should reflect current or past effort only.

### 2. Sort by Most Recent First

* **Action:** List preparation rows in **descending date order** (most recent first).
* **Rationale:** This improves usability, as users typically update today’s log — not older ones.

### 3. Email Notification for Missing Daily Entries

* **Action:** Implement an **email notification system** that triggers once per day (e.g., 9 PM) if the user has not filled preparation logs for **that day**.

#### Behavior Spec:

* Check if the current date has an entry in the `preparation_logs` table.
* If **any of the tracked categories** (e.g., Behavioral, Product Thinking, Analytical, Portfolio) are empty or missing:

  * Trigger email to the user.

#### Email Content Example:

```
Subject: Missing Preparation Entry for May 26

Hi [User],

We noticed you haven't filled in your preparation log for today, May 26. Here's what’s missing:

- Behavioral: ❌
- Product Thinking: ✅
- Analytical: ❌
- Product Portfolio: ❌

Take 5 minutes to reflect and fill in your prep log to stay consistent.

You've got this!

```

* **Bonus:** Allow users to configure notification time and enable/disable this reminder from the Settings page.

Let me know if you'd like this formalized into:

* A development checklist
* Updated PRD sections
* UI component wireframes for improved layout

I can also draft the daily notification email template or write the cron job logic if you're implementing this in Bolt, Replit, or Supabase.
